# Backup Files

This folder contains backup files from the project simplification process.

## Files:

- `main_backup.py` - Original complex main.py file
- `database_backup.py` - Original complex database.py file  
- `data_fetcher_backup.py` - Original complex data_fetcher.py file
- `main_simple.py` - Simplified version of main.py (now used as main.py)
- `database_simple.py` - Simplified version of database.py (now used as database.py)
- `data_fetcher_simple.py` - Simplified version of data_fetcher.py (now used as data_fetcher.py)
- `requirements_original.txt` - Original requirements.txt file

## What was simplified:

1. **Removed complex provider factory system** - Now uses direct Alpha Vantage + Yahoo Finance fallback
2. **Streamlined database operations** - Removed complex indexing logic, kept essential functions
3. **Simplified API endpoints** - Focused on core functionality
4. **Reduced dependencies** - Removed unnecessary packages
5. **Cleaner error handling** - More straightforward logging and error management

## Fallback Strategy:

The simplified system now uses:
1. Alpha Vantage API (primary source)
2. Yahoo Finance web scraping (fallback for market cap)
3. Simple caching with Redis
4. DuckDB for data storage

This provides the same functionality with much cleaner, more maintainable code.
